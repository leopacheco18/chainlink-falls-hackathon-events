Evebst built with NodeJs for OpenMarket Project on Chainlink Falls Hackathon.

[Live Demo Hosted in Fleek](https://open-market-chainlink-falls-hackathon.on.fleek.co/#/)

OpenMarket is a marketplace where you can create chat to ask private questions before you want to buy a product. Also as a seller you can make sure that the buyer have the number.

With Chainlink datafeeds the price of the product could be in Matic or USD. Also, in order to make the most secure way to sell products, we create a random number with VRF and it is given to the buyer after deposit the money. And the seller needs this number to witdraw the money and transfer the nft.
